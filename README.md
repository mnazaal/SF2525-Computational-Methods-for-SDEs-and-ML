Main coursework for the module SF2525 Computational Methods for Stochastic Differential Equations and Machine Learning @ KTH Royal Institute of Technology

Contains PyTorch implementation for the paper  "Solving stochastic differential equations and Kolmogorov equations by means of deep learning" by Christian Beck et al. The paper can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00421.pdf). You can run it on a virtual Jupyter notebook (on binder) @ [bit.ly/code-csde](https://bit.ly/code-csde)
